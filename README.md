# NationCogs
NationStates utility cogs (and a fun Skryim guard lines cog) for use with [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)

Both nationstates and nationshards requires the [NationStates python wrapper](https://github.com/Dolphman/pynationstates). Your bot should automatically install it, but if it does not, 1) update your bot through the launcher, and/or 2) run `[p]debug bot.pip_install('nationstates')`, which will return `True` if the installation succeeded.

Download through your Red bot with:
`[p]cog repo add NationCogs https://github.com/zephyrkul/NationCogs`
